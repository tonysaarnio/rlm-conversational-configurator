# RLM Conversational Product Configurator (POC)

> An Agentforce-powered **natural-language configuration panel** for the Salesforce Revenue Cloud (RLM)
> Product Configurator. Proof-of-concept — reuses the org's existing, managed configuration engine rather
> than replacing it.

## Origin and relationship to the upstream POC

The component, its architecture and the original build are **[@lzdravkov](https://github.com/lzdravkov)'s**
work, in [lzdravkov/rlm-agent-config-concept](https://github.com/lzdravkov/rlm-agent-config-concept). This
repository is that POC made **portable**, after deploying it into a second org (Release 264 / API v68) that
already had the RLM engine under different service names.

What that took, and what changed here:

| Area | Upstream | Here |
|---|---|---|
| Engine calls | Named as compile-time Apex types | Reached by invocable-action **name** via `ConfigEngineBinding` |
| Engine/agent naming | Hardcoded constants | `RLM_Config_Engine_Binding__mdt` / `RLM_Agent_Binding__mdt` — Setup fields, no code change |
| Access | No permission set shipped | `RLM_Conversational_Configurator` |
| Credentials | Unused, broken, carried a real consumer key | Removed |
| Deploy commands | Two documented commands fail off the reference org | Corrected and verified |
| Live tests | Pinned to one org's record Ids | Discovered at run time; skip cleanly when absent |

Concretely: the upstream source produced **53 compile errors** on that org and needed a rename across four
files plus hand-edited record Ids. This build deploys at **28 components, 0 errors** and passes **75/75
tests** there with no source edits — your org's naming is a custom-metadata record, not a patch.

These changes were offered back upstream in
[lzdravkov/rlm-agent-config-concept#2](https://github.com/lzdravkov/rlm-agent-config-concept/pull/2) and the
stack behind it. This repository exists so the portable build is usable without waiting on that review; if it
merges, upstream is the better home.

## What this component does

The deliverable is a Lightning Web Component (`c:configChatPanel`) embedded in the right-hand column of the
RLM Product Configurator via a screen flow. A sales rep types free text; the panel classifies intent per
message and does one of two things:

- **Configuration turn** — *"~1500 kW, data-center continuous duty, low-voltage"* → a grounded Einstein LLM
  call maps the text to the product's **real** configuration attributes (validated against the catalog),
  shows an editable review card (or auto-applies a clean proposal), and publishes the selections into the
  managed configurator so it **applies, reprices, and re-renders natively**.
- **Guided-selling turn** — *"what do you recommend for a data center and why?"* → forwards the question to a
  live Revenue Management Agentforce (NGA) agent and renders its reasoned answer as chat. **Nothing is applied.**

**Two launch paths** are supported:

1. **Persisted line** (`0QL…`) — open a saved quote line → Configure. Grounds off the persisted `QuoteLineItem`.
2. **Pre-persist** — Configure directly from the product catalog (before Save), where only a transient
   `ref_<uuid>` configurator node exists. The panel detects this (`_isPrePersist`) and grounds off the
   **product's** classification instead (`ProductConfigGroundingService`).

Intent routing also selects the agent: pre-persist guided-selling turns go to the insight-only
`Revenue_Product_Advisor`; persisted-line turns go to the existing `Revenue_Quote_Management` agent
(the dual-agent bridge in `AgentAdvisorService`).

> **Dependencies (must pre-exist in the org):** the RLM engine + four protected engine services, the
> `Revenue_Quote_Management` agent, and Agentforce/Einstein platform settings. This repo deploys **on top of**
> a prepared org — it is not a from-scratch build. See [DEPLOYMENT_README.md](DEPLOYMENT_README.md) §2.

## How to use it

> **Audience:** a sales rep (or someone demoing) driving the panel in the browser. This assumes the feature is
> already deployed **and** the `Revenue_Product_Advisor` agent has been activated in Agent Builder 2.0
> (see [DEPLOYMENT_README.md](DEPLOYMENT_README.md) §5). After any redeploy of the LWC, **hard-refresh** the tab
> (Cmd+Shift+R) — the browser caches the old bundle aggressively.

### 1. Open the configurator with the panel

There are two ways in, and the panel adapts automatically:

- **From a saved quote line (persisted path):** open a Quote → open a configurable line (e.g. **FESBA Generator
  Set**) → **Configure**. The panel grounds off the saved `QuoteLineItem`.
- **From the product catalog (pre-persist path):** browse Catalogs → the configurable product →
  **Configure (before Save)**. There's no saved line yet (only a transient `ref_…` node); the panel detects this
  and grounds off the **product** instead. Everything below works the same.

The chat panel sits in the **right-hand column** next to the native configurator. The native panel remains the
source of truth for the resulting values and price.

### 2. Configure by typing a requirement

Type what you want in plain language and hit **Send**. Examples:

> *"~1500 kW, data-center continuous duty, low-voltage"*
> *"standby duty, 480V"*

What happens:

1. The panel maps your text to the product's **real** attributes and validates every value against the catalog —
   hallucinated attributes are dropped, illegal picklist values are flagged.
2. You get one of two outcomes:
   - **Review card** — an editable list of proposed attribute changes. Toggle rows on/off, adjust values, then
     click **Apply**.
   - **Auto-apply** — if auto-apply is on *and* the proposal is clean (every row valid and unambiguous), it skips
     the card and applies directly.
3. On **Apply**, the selections publish into the managed configurator, which **applies, reprices, and re-renders
   natively** on the left. Persisting the change is still the native configurator's **Save**.

> **Ambiguity is blocked, not guessed.** If a value maps to more than one catalog entry, the panel refuses that
> row (and drops auto-apply to manual review) rather than silently picking one.

### 3. Ask for advice (guided selling)

Ask a question instead of stating a requirement, and the panel routes it to a live Agentforce agent and shows the
answer as chat. Examples:

> *"What duty rating do you recommend for a data center, and why?"*
> *"How much full-load capacity do I need for a large data center?"*

- **Nothing is applied** on a question turn — it's insight only, even if your question happens to contain words
  that look like attribute values ("data center", "480V", …).
- Follow-up questions stay in the same agent conversation for the session (not persisted across a page reload).
- Expect roughly **8–9s** for an agent answer; a progress state is shown while it works.

### 4. How the panel tells the two apart

You don't flag your intent — the panel decides per message. A fast heuristic catches obvious questions (advice
words, question openers, a trailing "?"), and the same grounded LLM call that does extraction also classifies
**CONFIGURE vs ASK** as a backstop. If intent is ever unclear, it defaults to the **reviewable configuration
path** (never a silent apply), so a misread directive is always something you can see and confirm. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md §4](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full routing design.

## Deploy (quick pointer)

Full instructions — including the production coverage gate, agent activation, and gotchas — are in
[DEPLOYMENT_README.md](DEPLOYMENT_README.md). The staged order is:

1. **Apex** (with the three seam-based test suites — production orgs enforce the ≥75% coverage gate)
2. **LWC** — then **hard-refresh** the flow tab (aggressive browser caching)
3. **Flow** — deploys a new active version of `Agent_Product_Configurator_Flow`
4. **Agent bundle** (NGA) — `sf agent validate` then `sf project deploy start`; **never** `sf agent publish`/`create`
   (those create un-upgradeable legacy Bot 1.0 metadata)

Then two manual, user-side steps: **activate** `Revenue_Product_Advisor` in Agent Builder 2.0, and
**live-confirm** the pre-persist apply on a `ref_…` line.

**Deploying with an AI coding agent?** [DEPLOYMENT_README.md §11](DEPLOYMENT_README.md#11-deploy-with-an-ai-coding-agent-copypaste-prompt)
has a copy/paste prompt that runs all four steps, asserts the target org Id before writing anything, and stops at
the data boundary.
