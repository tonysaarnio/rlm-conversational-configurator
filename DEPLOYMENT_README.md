## 0. TL;DR (deploy to an already-prepared org)

```bash
# Set your target org alias once
ORG=rlm-agent-config-v2

# 1. Apex (ships tests — production-type orgs enforce the 75% coverage gate)
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/classes \
  -l RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests ConfigExtractionServiceTest --tests AgentAdvisorServiceTest --tests ProductConfigGroundingServiceTest \
  -o "$ORG" --wait 10

# 2. LWC  (then HARD-REFRESH the flow tab in the browser — see §6 gotchas)
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/lwc -o "$ORG" --wait 10

# 3. Flow (deploys a NEW ACTIVE version of Agent_Product_Configurator_Flow)
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/flows -o "$ORG" --wait 10

# 4. Agent bundle (NGA) — validate, then deploy
sf agent validate authoring-bundle --api-name Revenue_Product_Advisor -o "$ORG"
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/aiAuthoringBundles/Revenue_Product_Advisor -o "$ORG" --wait 10
```

**Then two manual, user-side steps that no CLI can do (see §5):**
1. **Activate `Revenue_Product_Advisor`** in Agent Builder 2.0 (Setup → Agents) — this creates the runtime Bot
   that makes the agent Apex-invocable.
2. **Live-confirm** the configurator apply on a pre-persist (`ref_…`) line.

> ⚠️ This repo deploys **on top of** an org that already has the RLM engine, the four protected engine services,
> and the existing `Revenue_Quote_Management` agent. It is **not** a from-scratch org build. See §2.

> 🤖 Prefer to have an AI coding agent run the whole thing? §11 has a copy/paste prompt that drives every step
> below, with an org-Id assertion so it cannot deploy to the wrong org.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Salesforce CLI (`sf`) | v2.x. `sf --version`. The `sf agent …` commands require a recent CLI. |
| Authenticated target org | `sf org login web -a <alias>`; confirm with `sf org display -o <alias>`. |
| Revenue Cloud (RLM) enabled | Product catalog, Product Configurator, and the managed **Data Manager** must be provisioned. |
| API v67.0+ | `sfdx-project.json` pins `sourceApiVersion: 67.0`; the NGA authoring-bundle floor is v65. |
| Agentforce / Einstein enabled | `enableEinsteinGptPlatform` + `enableAgentPlatform` must be ON in the org (see §2 — these are **not** in source). |
| Node (for LWC tooling, optional) | Only needed if running Jest locally; not required to deploy. |

**Org type matters.** The reference org is a **production-type** org (`IsSandbox=false`), so every Apex deploy
**must ship tests and clear the ≥75% coverage gate**. Sandboxes/scratch orgs can deploy without tests, but always
deploy with tests here to stay honest with the production path.

---

## 2. What must already exist in the target org (NOT in this repo)

This repo contains only the POC-authored components. The following are **dependencies that must pre-exist** — a
deploy into an org lacking them will fail to compile or will error at runtime:

- **Protected engine services** — `ProductAttributeService`, `ProductAttributeSaveService`,
  `ProductAttributeReadService`, `QuoteLineItemLookupService`. `ConfigEngineController` /
  `ConfigLmsGroundingService` call these; they are live in the org and are **not** committed here.
- **The existing agent** — `Revenue_Quote_Management` (NGA Employee agent: `BotDefinition` Type=InternalCopilot +
  `GenAiPlannerBundle`). `AgentAdvisorService` invokes it by API name for the **persisted-line** Q&A turn.
- **Agentforce baseline settings** — `EinsteinGpt` (`enableEinsteinGptPlatform=true`) and `AgentPlatform`
  (`enableAgentPlatform=true`). There is **no `settings/` folder in this repo** — these were enabled directly in
  the org. If deploying to a fresh org, enable them first (Setup → Einstein / Agentforce, or add the settings
  metadata) *before* step 4.
- **A configurable product with a classification** — e.g. FESBA Generator Set. Grounding reads
  `ProductClassificationAttr` + `AttributePicklistValue` off the product's `BasedOnId` classification.

---

## 3. Source layout (what deploys, what's reference-only)

```
force-app/main/default/
  classes/
    ConfigEngineController.cls            # thin @AuraEnabled over the protected engine (read/apply)
    ConfigExtractionService.cls           # grounded NL→fields extraction + intent classification (+productId)
    ConfigLmsGroundingService.cls         # attributeId + picklist label→0v6-Id map (persisted path)
    ProductConfigGroundingService.cls     # NEW — pre-persist grounding off the PRODUCT (zero-drift SOQL)
    AgentAdvisorService.cls               # dual-agent bridge (Revenue_Product_Advisor | Revenue_Quote_Management)
    *Test.cls                             # deploy-gate coverage (seam-based, no live Einstein/agent credits)
  lwc/
    configChatPanel/                      # THE deliverable — pre-persist aware, LMS publish+subscribe
    configRefreshProbe/  spikeConfigApply/                          # diagnostic / spike
    renderDraw3DConfigurationPrototype/   # ⚠ reference only — WILL NOT DEPLOY without org-resident UTIL_ConfigHelper
  flows/
    Agent_Product_Configurator_Flow.flow-meta.xml   # OURS — embeds configChatPanel; deploy = new active version
    RenderDraw_Product_Configurator_Flow.flow-meta.xml   # reference flow (protected; unchanged)
  aiAuthoringBundles/
    Revenue_Product_Advisor/              # NEW — NGA insight-only agent (.agent + .bundle-meta.xml)
  permissionsets/
    RLM_Conversational_Configurator…     # class + object access for panel users
```

**Do NOT modify / redeploy as changes:** the four protected engine services (not in repo),
`renderDraw3DConfigurationPrototype`, `RenderDraw_Product_Configurator_Flow`, and the `Revenue_Quote_Management`
agent. `ConfigLmsGroundingService` and `ConfigEngineController` are reference for this feature and were not changed
in the pre-persist work — no need to redeploy them unless you actually edit them.

### If your agents are named differently

Same idea as the engine binding below, for the two Agentforce agents:

> **Setup → Custom Metadata Types → RLM Agent Binding → Manage Records → Default**

| Field | Default | Used when |
|---|---|---|
| `Saved_Line_Agent__c` | `Revenue_Quote_Management` | a persisted `0QL…` line exists |
| `Pre_Persist_Agent__c` | `Revenue_Product_Advisor` | launched from the catalog, before save |

Blank falls back to the default. Deploying the agent bundle does not create a runtime agent — see §5a.

### If your engine services are named differently

This repo deploys **on top of** an org that already has the RLM configurator engine, and that engine is not
always named the same way — a namespace or a local prefix (e.g. `RLM_AI_ProductAttributeService`) is common.

You do **not** need to edit Apex for this. The controller reaches the engine by invocable-action *name* through
`ConfigEngineBinding`, and the names live in custom metadata:

> **Setup → Custom Metadata Types → RLM Config Engine Binding → Manage Records → Default**

| Field | Default | Set it to |
|---|---|---|
| `Options_Action__c` | `ProductAttributeService` | your org's attribute-options action |
| `Save_Action__c` | `ProductAttributeSaveService` | your org's save action |
| `Read_Action__c` | `ProductAttributeReadService` | your org's readback action |

Blank fields fall back to the defaults, so an org using the stock names needs no configuration at all. To find
the names in your org: **Setup → search "Apex Classes"**, or list the invocable actions with
`sf api request rest "/services/data/v68.0/actions/custom/apex" -o "$ORG"`.

If a name is wrong you get an actionable error rather than a crash — the panel reports
`Engine action "…" was not found in this org`, naming the action it tried and pointing at this record.

> ⚠️ **`renderDraw3DConfigurationPrototype` cannot deploy to most orgs.** It imports three methods from
> `UTIL_ConfigHelper`, which is org-resident and *not* in this repo, so any deploy whose scope includes it fails
> with `Unable to find Apex action class referenced as 'UTIL_ConfigHelper'`. It is reference material — keep it out
> of your deploy scope (the staged §4 order does this; the whole-folder shortcut in §10 does not).

---

## 4. Deploy order (and why it matters)

Deploy in this sequence; each step is independently verifiable.

### Step 1 — Apex (with tests)

```bash
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/classes \
  -l RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests ConfigExtractionServiceTest --tests AgentAdvisorServiceTest --tests ProductConfigGroundingServiceTest \
  -o "$ORG" --wait 10
```

- These three **seam-based** suites pass deterministically and cover the changed classes
  (ProductConfigGroundingService 92%, ConfigExtractionService 87%, AgentAdvisorService 84%).
- **Do NOT add `ConfigEngineControllerTest` or `ConfigLmsGroundingServiceTest` to `--tests` on a clone/new org.**
  They are **live-data** tests that hardcode the original org's line Id `0QLg8000001RYgDGAW`; they fail with
  `QuoteLineItem not found` on any org that doesn't have that exact record, which would block the deploy. Re-point
  their fixtures first (see §7) if you need them.
- **Known CLI quirk:** if `deploy … -l RunSpecifiedTests` reports tests **Skipped** (Passing 0 / Failing 0) because
  the components were unchanged, run the tests explicitly to confirm coverage:
  ```bash
  sf apex run test \
    --tests ConfigExtractionServiceTest --tests AgentAdvisorServiceTest --tests ProductConfigGroundingServiceTest \
    --code-coverage --result-format human -o "$ORG" --wait 20
  ```

### Step 2 — LWC

```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/lwc -o "$ORG" --wait 10
```

> **After every LWC redeploy, HARD-REFRESH the flow tab** (Cmd+Shift+R, or close+reopen the tab). The browser caches
> the old bundle aggressively and will keep running it — this has masked a fix before.

### Step 3 — Flow

```bash
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/flows/Agent_Product_Configurator_Flow.flow-meta.xml \
  -o "$ORG" --wait 10
```

- Deploying `Agent_Product_Configurator_Flow` creates a **new active version**. The pre-persist work added the
  `S01_DataManager.rootProductId → S00_ConfigChatPanel.rootProductId` input binding.
- **Target the single flow file, not the `flows/` directory.** The directory also holds the reference flow
  `RenderDraw_Product_Configurator_Flow`, which embeds the `c:renderDraw3DConfigurationPrototype` screen
  component; on an org without the org-resident `UTIL_ConfigHelper` that LWC does not exist, so deploying the
  directory fails with `We can't find an extension called "c:renderDraw3DConfigurationPrototype"` — even when the
  LWC itself is excluded from the deploy. The reference-only dependency is chained: reference flow → reference
  LWC → org-resident Apex.

### Step 4 — Agent bundle (NGA / Agent Builder 2.0)

```bash
# Validate first (catches DSL / indentation errors before deploy)
sf agent validate authoring-bundle --api-name Revenue_Product_Advisor -o "$ORG"

# Deploy the authoring bundle metadata
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/aiAuthoringBundles/Revenue_Product_Advisor \
  -o "$ORG" --wait 10
```

- **NEVER run `sf agent publish authoring-bundle` or `sf agent create`.** Both create **legacy** Bot 1.0 metadata
  (`bots/`, `genAiPlanners/`, `genAiFunctions/`, `genAiPlugins/`) that cannot be upgraded to NGA. Deploy the bundle
  with `sf project deploy start` only.
- Deploying the bundle creates the `AiAuthoringBundle` metadata **but does not create a runtime agent** — no Bot,
  no User, nothing activated. Activation is the manual step in §5.

---

## 5. Post-deploy — manual steps no CLI can do

### 5a. Activate the agent (Agent Builder 2.0 UI)

1. Setup → **Agents** (Agent Studio). `Revenue_Product_Advisor` appears with an NGA (arrow) icon.
2. Open it, set the **agent type = Employee**, assign an agent user **only if prompted** (this org runs Employee
   agents session-based with **no dedicated Einstein Agent User**, so the bundle intentionally commits no
   `default_agent_user`).
3. Click **Activate**. The runtime `BotDefinition` is created here — this is what makes the agent invocable from
   Apex via `createCustomAction('generateAiAgentResponse', 'Revenue_Product_Advisor')`.
4. **Retrieve the bundle back to source** to capture any UI-side changes, then check the `config:` block is still
   tab-indented (the org can reintroduce spaces on retrieve):
   ```bash
   sf project retrieve start --source-dir force-app/main/default/aiAuthoringBundles/Revenue_Product_Advisor -o "$ORG" --wait 10
   ```

### 5a-bis. Assign the permission set

```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/permissionsets -o "$ORG" --wait 10
sf org assign permset --name RLM_Conversational_Configurator -o "$ORG"
```

`RLM_Conversational_Configurator` grants the five Apex classes the LWC imports plus read on Quote,
QuoteLineItem and Opportunity. An admin running with `ViewAllData`/`ModifyAllData` will not notice its absence,
which is exactly why it is easy to ship a build that works for you and fails for every other user — assign it to
anyone who will open the panel.

### 5b. Smoke-test the agent

```bash
SID=$(sf agent preview start --authoring-bundle Revenue_Product_Advisor -o "$ORG" --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.result.sessionId')
sf agent preview send --session-id "$SID" --authoring-bundle Revenue_Product_Advisor \
  --utterance "CONTEXT: productId=01t... productName=FESBA Generator Set attributes=[DutyRating (Picklist): Standby, DataCenterContinuous; requiredKW (Number)]

what duty rating do you recommend for a data center and why?" -o "$ORG" --json
sf agent preview end --session-id "$SID" --authoring-bundle Revenue_Product_Advisor -o "$ORG" --json
```

Expect a grounded recommendation that spells the picklist value exactly as in CONTEXT and applies nothing.

### 5c. Live-confirm the pre-persist apply (`ref_` spike)

Browse Catalogs → the configurable product → **Configure (before Save)** → confirm the panel loads (no
"QuoteLineItem not found"), type a requirement, Apply, and verify the native configurator updates + reprices. This
confirms the Data Manager accepts a `valueChanged` whose `key` is `["ref_…"]` — the one apply assumption that can
only be checked live.

---

## 6. Gotchas & platform constraints

- **Known defect — picklist `Name` vs `Value` misalignment on save/readback.** The panel proposes a picklist
  selection by its **label** (`AttributePicklistValue.Name`), but the engine stores and reads back the **value**
  (`AttributePicklistValue.Value`). Where the two differ, the persisted configuration holds a token matching none
  of the options the panel offers, so the attribute cannot be re-selected on reload and the diff reports
  `changed:true` for a selection the user never changed. Invisible on the FESBA reference product, where `Name`
  and `Value` are equal; reproducible anywhere they diverge (e.g. a *Base Core Count* whose labels are
  `Two/Four/Six/Eight` but whose values are `2/4/6/8` — apply `"Eight"`, read back `"8"`). This is the
  "multi-product scale caveat" that `07-discovered-engine.md` flags as theoretical. The cheapest fix is to
  normalise on readback inside `ConfigEngineController`, mapping the returned `Value` back to its `Name` using
  the label→id map `ConfigLmsGroundingService` already computes; keying the panel on
  `AttributePicklistValue.Id` end-to-end is the more thorough one. Both stay clear of the org-resident engine.
- **`.agent` files are TAB-ONLY.** Agent Builder 2.0 rejects space-indented `.agent` files with `PARSE_EXCEPTION`
  even when `sf agent validate` passes. Editor protection is committed: `.editorconfig` `[*.agent]` +
  `.vscode/settings.json` `[agentscript]` (`insertSpaces:false`, `formatOnSave:false`, `formatOnPaste:false`).
  Keep these; do not let an editor reformat the file. Verify with: `grep -nP '^ ' Revenue_Product_Advisor.agent`
  (must return nothing).
- **LWC caching** — hard-refresh after every LWC deploy (§4 Step 2).
- **Transient `ref_` lines** — pre-persist, `quoteLineItemId` is a `ref_<uuid>` node id, not a `0QL…` record. The
  panel detects this (`_isPrePersist`) and grounds off `rootProductId`; the QLI wires are suppressed via an
  `undefined` reactive param so they never fire with a `ref_`.
- **Production coverage gate** — each deployed Apex class needs ≥75% coverage from the tests you specify, and those
  tests must pass. That's why §4 specifies only the passing seam-based suites.
- **No secrets in source — and do not rely on the repo being private, because it is not.** This repo is **public**.
  An earlier revision of this guide asserted it was private and used that as the justification for committing an
  OAuth consumer key into the `ExternalCredential` metadata; that credential metadata has since been removed (it
  was also unused and would not deploy). Treat every commit as world-readable: no org auth (`.sf/`, `.sfdx/` are
  gitignored), no client ids or secrets, no `.env`. External-credential secrets belong on the principal in the
  org, never in metadata. Note that deleting a committed credential does **not** unpublish it — anything already
  pushed must be **rotated** in the org, not just removed from the tree.

---

## 7. Deploying to a NEW / clone org (fixture drift)

Record Ids differ between orgs. When deploying to a clone or a fresh org:

- **Re-capture fixtures.** The live/`SeeAllData` tests reference specific records. The clone `rlm-agent-config-v2`
  uses: FESBA product `01tgK00000EPnyuQAD` (classification `11BgK00000h2GWCUA2`), Quote `0Q0gK000002dwcTSAQ`.
- **Live-data tests will fail until re-pointed.** `ConfigEngineControllerTest` and `ConfigLmsGroundingServiceTest`
  hardcode the *original* org's line Id `0QLg8000001RYgDGAW`. On any other org they fail (`QuoteLineItem not
  found`). This is stale-fixture drift, **not** a code regression. To make the full suite green, re-point those
  tests to a persisted `0QL…` configurable line in the target org (or exclude them from the deploy test set as in
  §4).
- **Enable Agentforce/Einstein settings** and confirm the protected engine + `Revenue_Quote_Management` agent exist
  (§2) before deploying.

---

## 8. Verify the whole deploy

```bash
# Focused: the changed feature classes (should all pass)
sf apex run test \
  --tests ConfigExtractionServiceTest --tests AgentAdvisorServiceTest --tests ProductConfigGroundingServiceTest \
  --code-coverage --result-format human -o "$ORG" --wait 20

# Full local suite (expect the known live-data + unrelated RLM_* failures on a clone — see §7)
sf apex run test -l RunLocalTests --code-coverage --result-format human -o "$ORG" --wait 20
```

Then walk the end-to-end script in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §3 / the plan's verification steps: catalog
Configure (pre-persist) → configuration turn → guided-selling turn → persisted-line non-regression.

---

## 9. Rollback

The project is **git-backed** (private repo, branch `rlm-config-agent-v2`).

- **Revert source:** `git revert <sha>` or check out a prior commit, then redeploy the affected `--source-dir`.
- **Flow:** deploying an older flow definition creates another new active version; the configurator picks up the
  active version. There is no destructive delete needed.
- **Agent:** deactivate `Revenue_Product_Advisor` in Agent Builder 2.0, or delete the `AiAuthoringBundle` via a
  destructive change set if it must be removed. `AgentAdvisorService` still compiles either way (the agent name is a
  string), but the pre-persist Q&A turn will error at runtime until the agent is active again.
- Change points before 2026-07-20 predate git — see the `backups/` folders referenced in
  `PROJECT-JOURNAL.md`.

---

## 10. Command reference (copy/paste)

```bash
ORG=<your-org-alias>

# Deploy everything DEPLOYABLE in one shot (tests included).
# NOTE: this deliberately lists directories rather than passing `--source-dir force-app`,
# which fails — see the note below.
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/classes \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/lwc/configChatPanel \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/lwc/configRefreshProbe \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/lwc/spikeConfigApply \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/flows/Agent_Product_Configurator_Flow.flow-meta.xml \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/permissionsets \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/aiAuthoringBundles/Revenue_Product_Advisor \
  -l RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests ConfigExtractionServiceTest --tests AgentAdvisorServiceTest --tests ProductConfigGroundingServiceTest \
  -o "$ORG" --wait 20

# Validate the agent bundle
sf agent validate authoring-bundle --api-name Revenue_Product_Advisor -o "$ORG"

# Retrieve the agent bundle back after UI activation
sf project retrieve start --source-dir force-app/main/default/aiAuthoringBundles/Revenue_Product_Advisor -o "$ORG" --wait 10

# Confirm the org + API version
sf org display -o "$ORG"
```

> ⚠️ **`--source-dir force-app` does not work** — this was previously described here as "harmless", which was
> wrong. The folder contains `renderDraw3DConfigurationPrototype`, which depends on the org-resident
> `UTIL_ConfigHelper` (see §3); on an org without that class the deploy fails outright rather than degrading. The
> command above lists the deployable directories explicitly for that reason. The staged per-directory order in §4
> is still preferred for a clean, verifiable rollout (and lets you hard-refresh between the LWC and Flow steps).

---

## 11. Deploy with an AI coding agent (copy/paste prompt)

Every step in this guide is CLI-driven, so an AI coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI, …) can
run the whole deploy end to end. The prompt below is the one this guide was last exercised with. It is written
to be **safe by construction**: the agent has to prove it is pointed at the right org before it writes anything,
and it stops at the data boundary rather than guessing.

Fill in the four fields at the top and paste it as-is.

```text
Deploy this GitHub repo into my Salesforce org.

Repo:            <git URL or local path>
Org:             <sf CLI alias>
Expected Org Id: <00D…>
Login type:      production          # or: sandbox

Do this:
1. Clone the repo into a subfolder here.
2. Read README.md, sfdx-project.json / cumulusci.yml, and the source tree.
   Tell me what the repo is and which deploy mechanism you'll use.
3. Make sure `sf` (and `cci` if needed) are installed; if not, stop and tell me.
4. Confirm the target org before touching it:
   - Run `sf org display --target-org <alias>` WITHOUT printing the access token
     (prefer `--json` and surface only alias, username, orgId, instanceUrl,
     connectedStatus). If a temp "show secrets" env var is set, don't echo the token.
   - If it errors with NamedOrgNotFoundError / not authorized: do NOT substitute a
     similarly-named org even if the CLI suggests one. Run
     `sf org login web --alias <alias> --instance-url <login url for my Login type>`,
     then PAUSE and tell me to finish the browser login before continuing.
   - Re-run the display, verify Connected, and if I gave an Expected Org Id, assert
     it matches EXACTLY. On any mismatch, stop and ask — never deploy.
5. Run a validate/dry-run deploy and show me the plan.
6. Deploy. (Once the org is confirmed in step 4, you are pre-approved to run the
   metadata deploy; data loads/deletes still require my explicit approval.)
7. Do EVERY post-deploy step the README calls for — permission sets, feature
   toggles, sample data, field/config that isn't on a layout, activation order.
   List anything you cannot automate so I can do it by hand.
8. Verify the deploy succeeded and give me a short summary of what changed and
   what's left for me to do.

Stop and ask me before anything destructive or anything that loads/deletes data.
```

### Why the prompt is shaped this way

Three of its clauses exist because the obvious failure modes are all silent ones:

- **Assert the org Id, and never accept a substitute.** When an alias isn't authorized the CLI helpfully suggests
  a similarly-named org, and an agent left to its own judgement will take the suggestion. Pinning `Expected Org Id`
  turns "deployed to the wrong org" from a plausible outcome into an impossible one.
- **Dry-run before deploy, and draw the approval line at data.** Metadata deploys are reversible; data loads and
  `deleteOldData`-style operations are not. Pre-approving step 6 keeps the run unattended without handing over the
  destructive operations.
- **Demand the post-deploy steps explicitly.** The parts of this deploy that a CLI *cannot* do (§5 — agent
  activation, permission-set assignment, the live apply confirmation) are exactly the parts an agent will otherwise
  declare "done" without doing. Asking it to list what it could not automate surfaces them.

### Repo-specific notes worth appending to the prompt

Paste these under the numbered list when targeting an org that isn't the reference org — they correspond to §2,
§4 and §7:

```text
Notes for this repo specifically:
- Deploy in the staged order in DEPLOYMENT_README.md §4 (classes → lwc → flows → agent
  bundle). Do NOT deploy the whole force-app folder in one shot: it includes
  reference-only components that depend on org-resident Apex.
- This repo deploys ON TOP OF an org that already has the RLM configurator engine.
  If the engine services exist under different names in my org, tell me before
  editing anything — do not silently rename across the source tree.
- The live-data tests hardcode the reference org's record Ids and attribute names.
  Expect them to fail on any other org; re-point them or exclude them (§4, §7),
  and tell me which you did.
- The agent bundle must be activated by hand in Agent Builder 2.0 (§5a). Deploying
  it does NOT create a runtime agent.
```
